                <li>Cartoon page must have a title.</li>
                <li>Include a link under the canvas to return to your main page. You should use an external JS file for your JavaScript code.</li>
                <li>Comment the different sections of your cartoon using JS comments, 
                    so that someone can easily understand what is being drawn.</li>

            <ul>
